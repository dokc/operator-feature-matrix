        description: |
          The operator creates by default or allows the user to request one or more Kubernetes Service(s) to be created to expose the system connections.
          Expected capabilities should include a RW (read-write) or RO (read-only in case of cascading replication) connection to the primary instance; and, optionally, a RO (read-only) to load balance read-only replicas instances in the cluster.
        vendor_compliance: |
          The value must be one of:

          * PrimaryAndReplicas: Primary and replicas services must be offered.

          * Primary: Primary service must be offered.
        value: "Balanced"
        comments: |
          Druid is built with microservices architecture. There is no really primary-secondary. There is an option to deploy
          a Kubernetes Service for each component with then references to all pods from that type.

        description: |
          If the user's selected storage technology supports transparent scaling, the operator will take care of scaling the storage automatically

        comments: |
          NOTE: This feature has been tested only on cloud environments and storage classes which have supported volume expansion. This feature uses cascade=orphan strategy to make sure only Stateful is deleted and recreated and pods are not deleted.

        name: Scale down to zero
        type: boolean
        description: |
          The number of pods in the cluster can be set to 0. This implies that no pods (no compute) would be used, but storage is not removed.
          Upon scaling up, the cluster should be brought back up without the need to restore a backup. This feature may also be known as "hibernation".
        value: true
        comments: |
          Druid saves its data in a remote storage (like S3 bucket), in case of scaling to zero and then scaling back up, the data will be loaded back
          from the remote store.

        type: boolean
        description: |
          The operator allows the user to specify custom (user-provided) Druid container images, instead of using the operator's provided images.
        vendor_compliance: |
          The operator should specify if the custom image needs to follow some minimal patterns to be able to work, or if it can work
          with any postgres container image provided.

          If the operator supports Service Binding, applications that are bound to the Postgres clusters will be able to fetch database access credentials without requiring
          the user to specify them manually in the application.
        vendor_compliance: |

        vendor_compliance: |
          The operator must provide configuration for setting Annotations on all objects generated by the operator.
          Partial compliance is achieved if at least Pods can be annotated and this is clearly marked in the comments.

          This is typically used to store backups on different object stores (for protection purposes) or to send them to different sites.
          It may also include different lifecycle policies.

          Operator-managed objects (CRDs) include specific fields that provide additional information about the Postgres instances.
          These fields are shown when querying the Kubernetes resources using tools like `kubectl`.
        vendor_compliance: |
          In order to be compliant, operators have to provide at least the following information:
          
          * Replication status (primary/replica/etc)
          * Cluster status (healthy/not healthy)
          * Postgres major/minor version

      - id: exdel
        name: Exposed decorated logs
        type: boolean
        description: |
          The operator provides a mechanism to expose all the logs of the managed Postgres instances to a centralized logging tool.
          The logs must be decorated with extra metadata in order to provide semantic meaning, including the Pod name and namespace, the cluster name, the role of the Postgres instance (e.g. primary, replica, standby-leader, etc.) and the timestamp that will be available to be used to filter logs entries.
          There is no need to configure the tool in order to obtain required extra metadata from the logs.
      - id: explg
        name: Export logs
        type: boolean

          Since a sharded cluster is a set of (independent) Postgres clusters, an aggregated dashboard is one that provides Observability information across all shards of the cluster.

          A sharded cluster can be backed up by backing up each shard independently, but those backups are not necessarily consistent with each other.
          If sharding is used, an additional capability is to coordinate backups on a given timestamp so that they are performed or can be restored at the same logical timestamp,
          so they become consistent with each other.
