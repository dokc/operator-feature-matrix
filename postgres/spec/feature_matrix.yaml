        main: true
      - id: pgsrv
        name: PostgreSQL exposed via Service
        type: string
        description: |
          The operator creates by default or allows the user to request one or more Kubernetes Service(s) to be created to expose the PostgreSQL connections.
          Expected capabilities should include a RW (read-write) or RO (read-only in case of cascading replication) connection to the primary instance; and, optionally, a RO (read-only) to load balance read-only replicas instances in the cluster.
        vendor_compliance: |
          The value must be one of:

          * PrimaryAndReplicas: Primary and replicas services must be offered.
          * PrimaryAndReplicasAndBalanced: Primary service, replicas services and a service that load balance RW/RO traffic transparently must be offered.

          * Primary: Primary service must be offered.
      - id: stosc
        name: Automatic storage scaling
        type: boolean
        description: |
          If the user's selected storage technology supports transparent scaling, the operator will take care of scaling the storage automatically
          (either by setting some default thresholds or requiring explicit declarative configuration from the user).
      - id: scal0
        name: Scale down to zero
        type: boolean
        description: |
          The number of pods in the cluster can be set to 0. This implies that no pods (no compute) would be used, but storage is not removed.
          Upon scaling up, the cluster should be brought back up without the need to restore a backup.
      - id: tblsp
        name: Tablespaces
        type: boolean
        description: |
          The user may specify one or more PostgreSQL tablespaces and their associated backing storage.
      - id: cupgi
        name: Custom Postgres images
        type: boolean
        description: |
          The operator allows the user to specify custom (user-provided) Postgres container images, instead of using the operator's provided images.
        vendor_compliance: |
          The operator should specify if the custom image needs to follow some minimal patterns to be able to work, or if it can work
          with any postgres container image provided.
      - id: uside
        name: User supplied sidecars
        type: boolean
        description: |
          The user may specify custom sidecars (containers or init containers) to be created alongside the Postgres container (and, possibly, other operator sidecars).
          User supplied sidecars must be able, by default or by configuration, to access the Postgres container filesystem and Unix Domain Sockets file.

      - id: srvbi
        name: Support for Service Binding
        type: boolean
        description: |
          [Service Binding](https://servicebinding.io/spec/core/1.0.0/) is a Kubernetes specification to "communicating service secrets to workloads in a consistent way".
          If the operator supports Service Binding, applications that are bound to the Postgres clusters will be able to fetch database access credentials without requiring
          the user to specify them manually in the application.
        vendor_compliance: |
          The operator must implement the [Provisioned Service](https://servicebinding.io/spec/core/1.0.0/#provisioned-service) part of the specification.
      - id: cuann
        name: Custom Annotations
        type: boolean
        description: |
          The operator allows the user to provide custom [Annotations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/)
          (aside from any operator generated Annotations) to the objects generated by the operator.
        vendor_compliance: |
          The operator must provide configuration for setting Annotations on all objects generated by the operator.
          Partial compliance is achieved if at least Pods can be annotated and this is clearly marked in the comments.
      - id: culab
        name: Custom Labels
        type: boolean
        description: |
          The operator allows the user to provide custom [Labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) to the objects generated by the operator.
        vendor_compliance: |
          The operator must provide configuration for setting Labels on all objects generated by the operator.
          Partial compliance is achieved if at Labels can be added to at least Pods and this is clearly marked in the comments.
      - id: apdnd
        name: Assign Pod to Node
        type: string
        description: |
          The operator allows Postgres Pods to be assigned to a specific set of Nodes based on some [Kubernetes known rules](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/). E.g. Node Labels, Affinity, etc.
        vendor_compliance: |
          Indicate one of the following values:
          
          * 'Complete': if the operator support all the rules to assign a Pod to a Node defined in the latest Kubernetes version specified under [vers/k8ver].
          * 'Partial': if the operator support only partially the rules to assign a Pod to a Node.

          A link for each supported rule or rules group to assign a Pod to a Node must be specified.
      - id: topsc
        name: Topology Spread Constraints
        type: boolean
        description: |
          The operator allows Postgres pods to specify [Topology Spread Constraints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints),
          to control how Pods are spread across the Kubernetes cluster among failure-domains such as regions, zones, nodes, and other user-defined topology domains.
  - id: harp
    name: HA & Replication
    features:
      - id: autfa
        name: Automated failover
        type: boolean
        description: |
          The operator provides the facility that in the event of a node or pod failure where the Postgres primary is affected,
          another Postgres pod (if it exists) will be promoted to primary. The operation must happen automatically without user intervention.
        main: true
      - id: techa
        name: HA Technology
        type: string
        description: |
          The technology (software name or technology principles) that support the high availability and automated failover capabilities of the operator.
        vendor_compliance: |
          Provide a succinct software or technology name. E.g.: Patroni, Stolon, Custom.
        main: true
      - id: asrep
        name: Asynchronous replication
        type: boolean
        description: |
          The operator allows to configure Postgres clusters using asynchronous streaming replication.
          Asynchronous is the default streaming replication mode in Postgres.
      - id: syrep
        name: Synchronous replication
        type: boolean
        description: |
          The operator allows to configure Postgres clusters using synchronous streaming replication.
          The operator must manage the configuration details based on the user's preferences on which nodes behave synchronously.
      - id: serep
        name: Semi-synchronous replication
        type: boolean
        description: |
          Semi-synchronous, or also called group or quorum replication, is a hybrid mode where a subset of the nodes is expected to replicate synchronously;
          and once that level is reached, the remainding nodes replicate asynchronously.
          That is, Postgres waits for confirmation of the write only from the synchronous nodes before considering the transaction committed.
      - id: derep
        name: Delayed replicas
        type: boolean
        description: |
          The operator allows the user to configure one or more replicas subject to a user-specified (intentional) replication lag.
          This is useful to have always an online instance with data "in the past" for analytics or data recovery purposes.
      - id: carep
        name: Cascading replication
        type: boolean
        description: |
          Postgres allows to create replicas that are fed from another replica, instead of replicating from the primary instance.
          This is interesting to alleviate the effects of replication on the primary; and allows to create arbitrary replication tree-like topologies.
      - id: exrep
        name: Replication from external origin
        type: boolean
        description: |
          The operator allows a Postgres cluster to be setup in recovery mode while replicating from an external (non-operator managed) Postgres origin.
          This allows migrations to the operator using streaming replication.
        vendor_compliance: |
          To implement the feature, the user should be able to provide arbitrary host, port, username and password (or other means of credential passing) of the origin.
      - id: walsh
        name: WAL Shipping
        type: boolean
        description: |
          WAL Shipping is a Postgres technique that allows replication via a shared storage mechanism where WAL files produced on the primary node are copied ("shipped") to the replica.
          This feature is useful for having replicas for example on DR sites, replicate over global storage object stores and others.
        vendor_compliance: |
          Implementing the feature implies both generating WAL files to a suitable location; as well as creating clusters that permanently read those WAL files and replicate from them.
      - id: prstb
        name: Promote standby cluster
        type: boolean
        description: |
          The operator allows the user to promote a standby cluster that is a cluster with primary in recovery mode so that the primary becomes RW. This feature is used in conjunction with [harp/exrep] and/or [harp/walsh] to make GEO-replicated and/or DR (Disaster Recovery) clusters on other regions, where a region is essentially an independent Kubernetes cluster.
        vendor_compliance: |
            Only applies if [harp/exrep] or [harp/walsh] are true.
            The operator must allow to promote a standby clusters replicating either via WAL Shipping and/or streaming replication.
        main: true
      - id: lorep
        name: Managed logical replication
        type: boolean
        description: |
          Postgres supports logical replication as well as streaming replication. It requires some configuration and commands to be run by the user.
          This feature represents operator capabilities to perform these operations in a managed way, without the user having to type commands or create configurations directly.
        vendor_compliance: |
          The operator is considered compliant if it allows the user to provide logical replication without having to setup it directly, just specifying (declarative) preferences.
          The operator is still considered compliant if it cannot proceed until certain operations are performed by the users that are dependent on their environment
          (e.g. adding PKs, UNIQUEs or REPLICA IDENTITY to the DDL).

        description: |
          A sharded cluster can be backed up by backing up each shard independently, but those backups are not necessarily consistent with each other.
          If sharding is used, an additional capability is to coordinate backups on a given timestamp so that they are performed or can be restored at the same logical timestamp,
          so they become consistent with each other.
