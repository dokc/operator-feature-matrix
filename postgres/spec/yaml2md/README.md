In order to export the markdown file containing the table version of the origin YAML, you must have [gomplate](https://github.com/hairyhenderson/gomplate) installed.


## Installing gomplate

Information on how to install the required command line tool can be found here: [https://docs.gomplate.ca/installing/](https://docs.gomplate.ca/installing/)

## Convert yaml to markdown table

```
sh yaml2md.sh

## Notes

- Make sure that the file `feature_matrix.yaml` is stored on the parent folder before running the script.
- The html file `feature_matrix.md` will be created on the parent folder.
