| serep | Semi-synchronous replication | boolean | Semi-synchronous, or also called group or quorum replication, is a hybrid mode where a subset of the nodes is expected to replicate synchronously;<br />and once that level is reached, the remainding nodes replicate asynchronously.<br />That is, Postgres waits for confirmation of the write only from the synchronous nodes before considering the transaction committed. |  |  |
| derep | Delayed replicas | boolean | The operator allows the user to configure one or more replicas subject to a user-specified (intentional) replication lag.<br />This is useful to have always an online instance with data "in the past" for analytics or data recovery purposes. |  |  |

| prstb | Promote standby cluster | boolean | The operator allows the user to promote a standby cluster that is a cluster with primary in recovery mode so that the primary becomes RW. This feature is used in conjunction with [harp/exrep] and/or [harp/walsh] to make GEO-replicated and/or DR (Disaster Recovery) clusters on other regions, where a region is essentially an independent Kubernetes cluster. | Only applies if [harp/exrep] or [harp/walsh] are true.<br />The operator must allow to promote a standby clusters replicating either via WAL Shipping and/or streaming replication.<br /> |  ✓  |
| lorep | Managed logical replication | boolean | Postgres supports logical replication as well as streaming replication. It requires some configuration and commands to be run by the user.<br />This feature represents operator capabilities to perform these operations in a managed way, without the user having to type commands or create configurations directly. | The operator is considered compliant if it allows the user to provide logical replication without having to setup it directly, just specifying (declarative) preferences.<br />The operator is still considered compliant if it cannot proceed until certain operations are performed by the users that are dependent on their environment<br />(e.g. adding PKs, UNIQUEs or REPLICA IDENTITY to the DDL).<br /> |  |

| migms | Migration from SQL Server | string_array | The operator provides a managed capability to automatically migrate data from a SQL Server database.<br />Migrations may be offline (source needs to be disconnected from clients while the migration happens) and/or via CDC (Change Data Capture),<br />which allows for near-zero downtime migrations.<br />Optionally, the operator may provide additional capabilities to convert the schema from the source database into the target Postgres database. | Provide one or more of the following values: `offline`, `cdc`, `schema conversion`.<br /> |  |
| migmo | Migration from MongoDB | string_array | The operator provides a managed capability to automatically migrate data from a MongoDB database.<br />Migrations may be offline (source needs to be disconnected from clients while the migration happens) and/or via CDC (Change Data Capture),<br />which allows for near-zero downtime migrations.<br />Optionally, the operator may provide additional capabilities to convert the schema from the source database into the target Postgres database. | Provide one or more of the following values: `offline`, `cdc`, `schema conversion`.<br /> |  |
| migot | Migration from other databases | string_array | The operator provides a managed capability to automatically migrate data from other relational or non-relational databases.<br />Migrations may be offline (source needs to be disconnected from clients while the migration happens) and/or via CDC (Change Data Capture),<br />which allows for near-zero downtime migrations.<br />Optionally, the operator may provide additional capabilities to convert the schema from the source database into the target Postgres database. | Provide the names of the other database from where migration is supported.<br /> |  |


## Sharding – [shrd](#shrd)
| **ID** | **NAME** | **TYPE** | **DESCRIPTION** | **VENDOR COMPLIANCE** | **MAIN CATEGORY** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| mshrd | Managed sharding support | boolean | The operator understands horizontal scalability and is capable to automatically deploying sets of clusters (shards) with their accompanying infrastructure (coordinators, services, etc).<br />The user should be able to write a declarative configuration of a sharded cluster and the operator to fully deploy it without any further manual user intervention. |  |  ✓  |
| shrdt | Sharding technology | string_array | If managed sharding support is provided, which technology or technologies are used to provide sharding support (which is not included in Postgres core). |  |  |
| aggds | Aggregated monitoring dashboards | boolean | Since a sharded cluster is a set of (independent) Postgres clusters, an aggregated dashboard is one that provides Observability information across all shards of the cluster.<br />E.g. total database size, tps processed or total number of client connections. |  |  |
| cobkp | Coordinated backups | boolean | A sharded cluster can be backed up by backing up each shard independently, but those backups are not necessarily consistent with each other.<br />If sharding is used, an additional capability is to coordinate backups on a given timestamp so that they are performed or can be restored at the same logical timestamp,<br />so they become consistent with each other. |  |  |
